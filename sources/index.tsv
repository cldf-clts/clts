NAME	DESCRIPTION	REFS	TYPE	URITEMPLATE
easterday	This dataset consists in the sound inventory part of [Easterday's (2019)](:bib:Easterday2019) study of complex syllable structures.	Easterday2019	td	
aus	This dataset is taken from a list of phoneme frequencies in the lexicons of 166 language varieties of Australia published by [Macklin-Cordes and Round (2020)](:bib:MacklinCordes2020).	MacklinCordes2020	td	
allenbai	This dataset was taken from the description of several Bai dialect varieties by [Allen (2007)](:bib:Allen2007). All sound segments were extracted from the original source and then mapped to the CLTS system. The detailed phoneme inventories per language as well as the lexical data reported in the same source are available in the form of a [CLDF dataset](https://github.com/lexibank/allenbai).	Allen2007	td	
apics	This is the segmental data provided by the [Atlas of Pidgin and Creole Language Structures Online](http://apics-online.info/).	Michaelis2013	td	
art	A numeric account of sonority based on LingPy as presented in List (2014) and List et al. (2017)	List2014d, List2017i	sc	
asjp	Sound class model (produced in a semi-generative manner with help of LingPy) following the ASJP (Wichmann et al. 2016) as used in List (2014).	Wichmann2016, List2014d	sc	
asjpcode	Transcription system of the ASJP project.	Wichmann2016	ts	
bdpa	The data is taken from the *Benchmark database of phonetic alignments* ([List and Prokić 2014](:bib:List2014e)) which offers data on sound sequences in segmented form. The frequency counts reflect the number of varieties in the data for which a given segment could be found. Since the data contains many dialectal datasets, the frequency counts to not reflect general sound distributions but rather the frequency of sound segments in the data.	List2014e	td	
bdproto	Transcription data assembled from the BDPROTO database, which offers phoneme inventories of proto-languages.	Moran2020	td	
beidasinitic	The inventories given in the Fāngyán Cíhuì (Beijing Daxue 1964).	Cihui	td	
bipa	Broad version of IPA, understood as a reference for the other systems.	IPA1999, IPA2015	ts	
chomsky	This is the feature system proposed by [Chomsky and Halle (1968)](:bib:Chomsky1968). The system is limited in so far as it only lists the sounds the scholars identify for English.	Chomsky1968	td	
color	A simple color-scheme based on Dolgopolsky's sound classes, used in LingPy.	List2017i, List2014d, Dolgopolsky1964, Dolgopolsky1986	sc	
cv	Simple consonant-vowel-tone sound class model provided by LingPy (List et al. 2017).	List2017i	sc	
diachronica	The online version of the Index Diachronica, which is no longer available in its original form.	Anonymous2014, D2017	td	
dolgo	Sound class model (produced in a semi-geneative manner with help of LingPy) following Dolgopolsky (1964) as used in List (2014).	Dolgopolsky1964, Dolgopolsky1986, List2014d	sc

gld	Transcription system of the Global Lexicostatistical Database project.	Starostin2011	ts	
jipa	Data from inventories published in the Journal of the International Phonetic Association (JIPA), as collected by Baird et al. (forth.)	BairdForth	td	
lapsyd	The data provided by the LAPSYD database.	Maddieson2013	td	
multimedia	The data presented on the Multimedia IPA Chart by the Department of Linguistics at University of Victoria.	IPA2017	td	
napa	A tentative reconstruction of what is known as the North-American Phonetic Alphabet. Our description is a compromise between different sources, especially Pullum and Ladusaw (1996), but also the information available in Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americanist_phonetic_notation).	Pullum1996	ts	
nidaba	The data offered by the Nidaba web application.	Eden2015	td	
panphon	The PanPhon project offers a Python API to validate IPA segments and to compare them using an extended feature system. For our project, we link to the PanPhon data file which lists 6454 segments in its current version, some of which are described by the same features and therefore aliases in our definition.	Mortensen2017	td	
pbase	The data provided by the PBase project which was collected for the study of Mielke (2008).	Mielke2008	td	http://pbase.phon.chass.ncsu.edu/visualize?lang=True&input={GRAPHEME}&inany=false&coreinv=on
phoible	The data provided by the Phoible project.	Moran2014	td	http://phoible.org/parameters/{ID}

upa	A transcription system is used predominantly for the transcription and reconstruction of Uralic languages.	ISON2419, Setala1901	ts	
wiki	This data is taken from the Wikipedia description of the phonetic alphabet. We have the ambition to link to all pages on Wikipedia dedicated to specific sounds in the world's languages. For the moment, however, the data is likely to contain a lot of gaps.	Wikipedia2018	td
